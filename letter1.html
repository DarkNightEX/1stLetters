<h2>When you miss me 💌</h2>

<p>
I know the distance is hard :(, but please remember that my heart
is always with you (real). Even when we’re far apart, you’re the first
person I think of every day. (based on true story)
</p>

<p>
I can’t wait for the day I get to hold you instead of just missing you.
